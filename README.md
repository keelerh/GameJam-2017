## Introduction

And Then There Was One is a murder mystery in which a troop of monkeys lives in a research lab peacefully passing their time collecting üçåüçåüçå. Sadly one monkey has gone bonkers! The rogue monkey is tranquilizing the other monkeys in the lab one at a time. Can the innocent monkeys identify and defeat the rogue monkey before it‚Äôs too late?

## Gameplay

![Gameplay](workers/unity/gameplay.gif)

At the beginning of the game one player is randomly assigned to be the murderer. The rogue monkey tries to kill the other monkeys without arising the attention of the innocent monkeys. The innocent monkeys win by correctly identifying and killing the rogue monkey. The rogue monkey wins if she/he is the last monkey standing.

### Rules

* Innocent monkeys must keep their banana count above zero or they will die from banana-deficiency
* The rogue monkey is immune from banana-deficiency (instead living off murderous thrill)
* If an innocent monkey incorrectly identifies and kills another innocent monkey, both monkeys die
  
### Controls
